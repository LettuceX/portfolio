<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>This project involved re-architecting a legacy desktop-based testing solution into a scalable, web-based distributed system capable of orchestrating simultaneous hardware tests across geographically separated machines.</p>

<h3>1. Architecture: Event-Driven Topology</h3>
<p>Transformed the system from a synchronous 1-to-1 control model to an asynchronous 1-to-Many distributed topology.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Decoupled Communication: </strong>Implemented Apache Kafka as the central message backbone. The web server functions as a producer, broadcasting control commands to specific Kafka topics.</li>
    <li><strong>Distributed Consumption: </strong>Physical test stations act as consumers, subscribing to relevant topics to receive instructions and publishing telemetry data back to the cloud database.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability: </strong>This architecture eliminated thread-blocking on the main server, allowing the system to scale to control hundreds of machines without performance degradation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Resource Management: Concurrency & Channel Bundling</h3>
<p>Developed the "Task Engine" to abstract physical hardware ports into logical test units.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Hardware Abstraction: </strong>Designed a scheduling system that allows users to bundle independent testing channels—residing on different physical machines—into a single logical "Task."</li>
    <li><strong>Concurrency Control: </strong>Implemented locking mechanisms and state management to ensure thread safety when multiple users attempt to reserve or control the same hardware channels simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. The Quality Control (QC) Pipeline Engine</h3>
<p>Designed and implemented a custom evaluation pipeline for automated manufacturing validation.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Domain-Specific Logic: </strong>Engineered a flexible rule-based engine that allows engineers to define "Pass/Fail" criteria using a custom scripting syntax (e.g., dynamic voltage thresholds per second).</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Visualization: </strong>Developed a dashboard that renders live telemetry (Voltage/Current/Capacity) using WebSockets for low-latency updates, enabling operators to monitor hundreds of active channels in a single view.</li>
</ul>
